It takes a certain amount of time for a computer to finish the execution of an algorithm. The time to completion (or response time in performance analysis terminology) is a performance metric that computer scientists and computer engineers should be concerned about because no one wants to wait unnecessarily. If you can understand the factors that determine the response time, then you can influence those factors so that the response time becomes acceptable. This course will take a mathematical modelling and analytical approach to understand response time in computer systems and networks. The primary goal is to explore how mathematical modelling and mathematical methods can be used to model, analyse and design computer systems and networks so that they have good performance. There are three major topics that will be covered by this course:",

      "courseDesc": "Privacy is a significant concern in modern society. Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared, or used. Privacy Engineering is the discipline concerned with applying an engineering approach to the analysis of privacy problems and the design of solutions in a systematic and sometimes formal manner.  It is concerned with data privacy and overall system privacy, including legal and ethical privacy goals.\n \nThe course provides a comprehensive overview of the field of “Privacy Engineering” and in-depth knowledge on information theoretic concepts and mechanisms for achieving privacy goals, including legal and ethical privacy goals. The course is designed to provide understanding of state-of-the-art privacy-preserving mechanisms including formal and human centric approaches, and the design and assessment of systems with privacy requirements and how to attack them. Students will learn concepts and methods for identifying privacy leakages and creating technologies with provable guarantees of privacy protection. Covered topics include: privacy leakages & attacks (e.g., identifiability of data, record linkage, data profiling, data anonymity, de-identification), privacy-by-design, state-of-the-art privacy enhancing technologies (e.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity), and emerging privacy concepts (e.g. user behavioural privacy, usable privacy, privacy & AI, privacy regulation, and ethics).",

Machine learning also is an empirical science, where performance of algorithms must be rigorously evaluated on datasets. Completion of this course will contribute to further learning in advanced topics such as deep learning, bioinformatics, computer vision, and robotics. Topics covered in the course include: linear models for regression and classification, local methods (nearest neighbour), tree learning, kernel machines, neural networks, unsupervised learning, ensemble learning, and learning theory. To expand and extend the development of theory and algorithms presented in lectures, practical examples will be given in tutorials and programming tasks during the project.",

Physics-based mathematical and statistical models as well as machine-learning methods are used to assist in the task. Current real-world applications are wide-ranging, and include optical character recognition, machine inspection, retail object recognition, 3D model building, remote sensing, medical imaging, autonomous driving, motion capture, surveillance, face recognition, biometrics, and many others. This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts and an opportunity to develop a real-world application of computer vision.",

Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared, or used. Privacy Engineering is the discipline concerned with applying an engineering approach to the analysis of privacy problems and the design of solutions in a systematic and sometimes formal manner.  It is concerned with data privacy and overall system privacy, including legal and ethical privacy goals.\n \nThe course provides a comprehensive overview of the field of “Privacy Engineering” and in-depth knowledge on information theoretic concepts and mechanisms for achieving privacy goals, including legal and ethical privacy goals. The course is designed to provide understanding of state-of-the-art privacy-preserving mechanisms including formal and human centric approaches, and the design and assessment of systems with privacy requirements and how to attack them. Students will learn concepts and methods for identifying privacy leakages and creating technologies with provable guarantees of privacy protection. Covered topics include: privacy leakages & attacks (e.g., identifiability of data, record linkage, data profiling, data anonymity, de-identification), privacy-by-design, state-of-the-art privacy enhancing technologies (e.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity), and emerging privacy concepts (e.g. user behavioural privacy, usable privacy, privacy & AI, privacy regulation, and ethics).",

This course is designed to elevate your programming skills by immersing you in the intricacies of coding, debugging, and optimizing software solutions. As you apply your theoretical knowledge of information technology/computer science concepts, algorithms, and data structures, you will actively bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. This course places a strong emphasis on teamwork and effective collaboration. You will navigate the challenges of group projects, learning to work seamlessly with peers, share responsibilities, and communicate ideas effectively. Beyond coding and collaboration, the course offers a comprehensive exploration of project management skills. From planning and scheduling to task prioritization, you will gain insights into the entire project lifecycle, experiencing firsthand the evolution of a concept into a completed solution. Furthermore, you will learn the art of crafting clear and concise project reports, and the skills to deliver impactful presentations.",

The Rust programming language is used as a reference language to teach considerations behind these concepts. As a language commonly cited to be well-considered, it serves as a good foundation to help students understand where countless other languages may let them down.

If you can understand the factors that determine the response time, then you can influence those factors so that the response time becomes acceptable. This course will take a mathematical modelling and analytical approach to understand response time in computer systems and networks.
