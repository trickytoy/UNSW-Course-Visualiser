# UNSW Course Visualiser

Visualises UNSW COMP Courses. The courses were first scraped from the UNSW website then imported into a neo4j DB and then all nodes and connections were extracted as a json file.

vis.js has been used for visualisation.

This only serves as a proof of concept for future projects

## Future Updates

Set up NEO4jDB endpoint for automatic upkeep
